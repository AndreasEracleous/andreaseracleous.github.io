        <p>I have worked with Andreas for over a year on various JavaScript based applications. He is everything you want in a developer. He is consistent, asks the right questions, is clever, and always seems to get the job done right. He has assisted me in many customer projects requiring HTML5 / Javascript dashboards and transactional apps. I highly recommend Andreas.</p>

        <p>What can I say? Andreas was incredible! We needed to get our project done ASAP and he jumped right on board. Total time from posting our job to it being done was mere hours! He was very responsive and professional. The quality of work is top notch. We will be using him again in the future and if I were you I would do the same!</p>
        <p>Job well done!!!</p>

        <p>Of the 20 something web developers & digital marketers I have used for various tasks in the past year, Andreas is the first person I talk to when I have an idea.</p>
        <p>He takes ideas and makes them better than you were originally thinking and he never asks you to review something that isn't finished.</p>
        <p>The quality of his code and creativity is worlds class. It's a joy to work with someone where things get done to such high quality without the need for lots of revisions.</p>
        <p>He has a bright future ahead of him, but for as long as he is available, he is my go to dev.</p>

        <p>Andreas skills are top notch. I have been using his services for a ongoing PSD to HTML project. I would highly recommend him if you are looking for a programmer who is super-fast and has great communication skills.</p>

        <p>Andreas, thanks so much for being our go to guy to get anything front-end up on the web as fast and efficiently as possible. You always go the extra mile and you always over-deliver. Thanks for being a great part of our team whenever we need you!</p>

        <p>I am just speechless that he did the job for me in less than 20 minutes since he took up the job. I believe he is simply blessed to have such brilliance of skills he says he has it.</p>
        <p>Anyone who wishes to offload a job to AndreasEracleous, can just do it with 100% peace of mind that the job is done perfectly and in time.</p>
        <p>God bless! I will return soon as always:)</p>
